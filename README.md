## Downloading Files Locally
**Method One - Git Clone with HTTPS**
1.  Click on the Green ```Code < >``` in the top right corner.
2.  Make sure that you are on the ```HTTPS``` tab and copy the URL.
*Example: https://github.com/jverdeci215/DockerDemo.git*
3.  Navigate to your folder either in your Terminal or open the folder in VSCode.
4.  Run the command ```git clone <COPIED_URL>```.

**Method Two - Git Clone with SSH**
1.  Follow these instructions to [check for existing ssh keys.](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)
2.  Follow these instructions to [generate new ssh keys.](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
*If given the option create an ed25519 key*
3.  Follow these instructions to [add ssh keys to your github account.](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
4.  Click on the Green ```Code < >``` in the top right corner.
5.  Make sure that you are on the ```SSH``` tab and copy the URL.
*Example: git@github.com:jverdeci215/DockerDemo.git*
6.  Navigate to your folder either in your Terminal or open the folder in VSCode.
7.  Run the command ```git clone <COPIED_URL>```.

**Method Three - Download ZIP Folder (LEAST PREFERED)**
If neither of the two above methods are working for you, download the ZIP File and manually unzip it on your local machine. It is always better to learn and troubleshoot how to use git commands; however, sometimes git breaks down and in the interest of time you just need to copy the files.
1.  Click on the Green ```Code < >``` in the top right corner.
2.  Click on the ```Download ZIP Archive``` beneath the tabs.
